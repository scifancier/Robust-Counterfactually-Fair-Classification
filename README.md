## Dependencies
We implement our methods by PyTorch on Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. The environment is as bellow:
- [Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download)
- [PyTorch](https://PyTorch.org/), version >= 0.4.1
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads), version >= 9.0
- [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/)



## Datasets

We process the raw data into *.npy* format, which can be found in the */dataset* folder of this repository.



## Runing the code
Here is an example for RCFC: 

```bash
python RCFC.py --dataset adult
```


Here is an example for R-*p*-Fair: 

```bash
python rpfair.py --dataset adult
```
